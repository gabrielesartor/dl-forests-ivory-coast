# DL-FORESTS-IVORY-COAST

This repository contains the code used to produce the results of the article "Deep Learning tools to support deforestation monitoring in the Ivory Coast using SAR and Optical satellite imagery" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11186).

The repository presents the scripts to perform training and test of the models, and the dataset creation.
To collect the dataset, it is necessary to have a Google Earth Engine account and enough space on disk to download the amount of images you want to use for training and test.
